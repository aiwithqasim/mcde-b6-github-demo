--1.  (Easy)  List every order with the customer's full name, store name, and the full name of the staff member who handled it.


SELECT
    o.order_id,
    c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name AS customer_name,
    s.store_name,
    st.first_name + ' ' + st.last_name AS staff_name

INNER JOIN sales.customers AS c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN sales.stores AS s
    ON o.store_id = s.store_id
INNER JOIN sales.staffs AS st
    ON o.staff_id = st.staff_id;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--2.Show each product with its brand name and category name. Include products even if they have no brand or category assigned.

SELECT
    p.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
    c.category_name
FROM production.products AS p
LEFT JOIN production.brands AS b
    ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id
LEFT JOIN production.categories AS c

INNER JOIN sales.order_items AS oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Subqueries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--7.  (Medium)  Find all products priced above the average list price of their own category.
--Hint: Use a correlated subquery.

    WHERE p2.category_id = p.category_id
);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--8.  (Medium)  List the customers who have placed more orders than the average number of orders per customer.


SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name AS customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM sales.customers AS c
INNER JOIN sales.orders AS o

GROUP BY
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > (
    SELECT AVG(order_count * 1.0)
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
        FROM sales.orders
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ) AS customer_orders
);

--CTEs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--9.  (Hard)  Using a CTE, calculate each customer's total spend, then return the top 10 customers with their spend and rank. Add a second CTE that labels each customer as "High" (above the overall average spend) or "Regular".

                THEN 'High'
            ELSE 'Regular'
        END AS spend_label

    total_spend,
    spend_rank,
    spend_label
FROM ranked_customers
ORDER BY spend_rank;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--10.  (Hard)  Using CTEs, find the best-selling product (by quantity) in each category, and show how much of that product's stock is currently available across all stores.
--Hint: Use ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() partitioned by category, then join to production.stocks.

WITH product_sales AS (
    SELECT
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,

        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY category_id
            ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM product_sales
),
stock_totals AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        SUM(quantity) AS total_stock
    FROM production.stocks
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT
    c.category_name,
    rp.product_name,
    rp.total_quantity,

INNER JOIN production.categories AS c
    ON rp.category_id = c.category_id
LEFT JOIN stock_totals AS st
